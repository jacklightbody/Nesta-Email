What this plugin does is quite simple. You set up an email address and then email something you want to get posted to your nesta blog. The next time email_nesta is executed, your email will be posted to your blog.
The required gems for this are 
mail
nesta
To setup edit email_nesta.rb with your information. To use with nesta place email_nesta.rb in the root folder of your nest installation. All your emails will be output as markdown files. To execute, simply use 
ruby mynestasite.com/email_nesta.rb
you may want to set up some kind of cron job for this.

Options:
EMAIL_HOST
the host of your email provider, without http:// and with .com or .org
EMAIL_TYPE
:pop3 or :smpt
EMAIL_PORT
The port you want the mail gem to use.
EMAIL_USERNAME
the username of your email account
EMAIL_PASSWORD
the password of your email account
EMAIL_MODE
two options, simple or advanced. Simple mode just email the body of your post, the app formats it for you. Advanced you email the post like you would write it normally in nesta.
